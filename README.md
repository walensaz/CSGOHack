# CSGOHack
While I'm not as proud about why I made this, it was still an amazing learning experience that will help me.  I made hacks for a game I played called Counter-Strike: Global Offensive to become better at the game.  This project was one that took months of research to figure out how to work it, and believe it or not it was my basic introduction into C++.  For this project I used memory pointers that pointed to specific objects to read what the game was seeing.  Using this I was able to then read or write to those memory pointers and change the way the game was perceived.  I will hope people will not use this maliciously and only as a learning experience.
